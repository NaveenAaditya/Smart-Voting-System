# Smart-Voting-System

INTRODUCTION:
In General Election 2019, Many local and national parties have Claimed that there was unethical
practice of voting and Tampering of EVM’s. One of the example was Ex Chief Minister of
Andhra Pradesh Was Claiming EVM tampering was happing in his state and that caused a
devastating loss for his Party. So We thought of keeping a period to this allegation. So, we got an
idea for fair elections with the help of IOT.
First Voting will be done with the help of 3 major ID proofs
• Fingerprint
• Face Recognition
• Voice Recognition
Implementing all these three verifications will give no chance for unethical voting practices and
also live status of the votes to a secure server of election commission. This will also help for
faster evaluation of results and restrict fake votes and multi voting. Fingerprint and Face
recognition can identify the person uniquely and there will be no error or failure of these systems
when used together. Also an algorithm will be implemented ,So if there exists any fear or being
frightened then immediately voice recognition will be activated ,after testing the intensity and
applying sentiment analysis on the speech ,if the system still tells the person is afraid of the
something or being compelled to vote for a respective party then the previous vote will be
removed and an alert call will be sent to polling station in-charge and a police head for
immediate presence and assistance for the civilian and help him and counsel the civilian to vote
on their will. Also all these data will be stored securely till results day for any further
investigation and this data will be automatically erased from the database after the 20 official
working days for providing privacy to civilians.

OBJECTIVES:

• To implement Fingerprint sensor in voting system so that the person can be uniquely
identified.
• To implement voice recognition to identify whether the person is frightened or not using
an algorithm.
• To implement Face recognition so that we can identify the emotion of the person whether
he is afraid or not. Face recognition is also used with finger print sensor to identify the
person uniquely.
• By using the above three modules, our objective is to develop a way such that there are
no unethical voting practices and to restrict fake votes and multi voting.
